# 🔄 Customer Branch Assignment Update - Last Order Logic

## Critical Change

**Updated customer branch assignment logic:**
- **Before:** Customers were assigned based on `branch_details` relation on user record
- **After:** Customers are assigned based on **their last order's branch**

This is a more accurate representation since customers' branch association should be determined by where they actually ordered from, not a static field.

---

## 🎯 Why This Change?

### **Business Logic:**
```
Customer Branch = Branch of Most Recent Order
```

**Rationale:**
- Customers don't have a permanent branch assignment
- Their "branch" is dynamic based on purchase behavior
- Last order branch shows current customer-branch relationship
- Admins see customers who recently ordered from their branch

**Example:**
- Customer John places order from Branch A → John is "assigned" to Branch A
- Later, John places order from Branch B → John is now "assigned" to Branch B
- Branch A admin no longer sees John
- Branch B admin now sees John

## 📝 Changes Made

### **1. Service Layer - readCustomers.js**

#### **Added Helper Function:**
```javascript
async function getCustomerLastOrderBranch(customerId, allOrders = null) {
  // Fetches customer's orders
  // Returns branch ID of most recent order
  // Returns null if no orders
}
```

#### **Updated getCustomersByRole():**
```javascript
// Fetch all customers
const customers = await pb.collection("users").getFullList({
  filter: 'role = "customer"'
});

// Fetch all orders
const allOrders = await pb.collection("user_order").getFullList({
  expand: 'branch'
});

// Enrich customers with last order branch
const customersWithBranch = customers.map(customer => {
  const customerOrders = allOrders.filter(o => o.user === customer.id);
  return {
    ...customer,
    lastOrderBranch: customerOrders[0]?.branch || null,
    lastOrderBranchDetails: customerOrders[0]?.expand?.branch || null
  };
});

// For admins: filter by lastOrderBranch
const filtered = customersWithBranch.filter(customer => {
  return customer.lastOrderBranch &&
         accessibleBranches.includes(customer.lastOrderBranch);
});
```

**Key Changes:**
- ❌ Removed: `expand: 'branch_details'` from user query
- ✅ Added: Fetch all orders with branch expansion
- ✅ Added: `lastOrderBranch` field to customers
- ✅ Added: `lastOrderBranchDetails` field to customers
- ✅ Changed: Filter logic from `branch_details` to `lastOrderBranch`

### **2. Components Updated**

#### **DataTable.jsx**
```diff
- const branchName = customer.expand?.branch_details?.branch_name;
+ const branchName = customer.lastOrderBranchDetails?.branch_name;

- header: "Branch"
+ header: "Last Order Branch"

- "Unassigned" badge
+ "No Orders" badge
```

#### **CustomerDetailsDialog.jsx**
```diff
- {customer.expand?.branch_details ? (
+ {customer.lastOrderBranchDetails ? (
    <Card>
      <CardTitle>
-       Branch Assignment
+       Last Order Branch
      </CardTitle>

-     {customer.expand.branch_details.branch_name}
+     {customer.lastOrderBranchDetails.branch_name}

+     <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
+       This is the branch from the customer's most recent order
+     </div>
    </Card>
  ) : (
-   "This customer is not assigned to any branch"
+   "This customer has not placed any orders yet"
  )}
```

#### **Filters.jsx**
```diff
- <SelectValue placeholder="Filter by branch..." />
+ <SelectValue placeholder="Filter by last order branch..." />

- <SelectItem value="unassigned">Unassigned</SelectItem>
+ <SelectItem value="no-orders">No Orders Yet</SelectItem>
```

#### **CustomerList.jsx**
```diff
// Filter logic
- if (branch === 'unassigned') {
-   filtered = filtered.filter(customer => !customer.branch_details);
+ if (branch === 'no-orders') {
+   filtered = filtered.filter(customer => !customer.lastOrderBranch);
  } else {
-   filtered = filtered.filter(customer => customer.branch_details === branch);
+   filtered = filtered.filter(customer => customer.lastOrderBranch === branch);
  }

// Info banner
- "Viewing all customers from all branches (Super Admin)"
+ "Viewing all customers (Super Admin) - Use filter to see customers by their last order branch"

- "Viewing customers from your assigned branch only (Admin)"
+ "Viewing customers who last ordered from your branch (Admin)"
```

## 🎨 UI Changes

### **Super-Admin View:**

**Before:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Branch Filter: [All Branches ▼]        │
│   - All Branches                        │
│   - Unassigned                          │
│   - Branch A, Branch B...               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Table Column: "Branch"
Badge: "Unassigned" (for no branch_details)
```

**After:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Branch Filter: [Last Order Branch ▼]   │
│   - All Branches                        │
│   - No Orders Yet                       │
│   - Branch A, Branch B...               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Table Column: "Last Order Branch"
Badge: "No Orders" (for no orders)
```

### **Customer Details Dialog:**

**Before:**
```
Branch Assignment
├─ Branch Name: Branch A
└─ (Static assignment)
```

**After:**
```
Last Order Branch
├─ Branch Name: Branch A
├─ ℹ️ This is the branch from the customer's most recent order
└─ (Dynamic, based on orders)
```

---

## 🔍 Data Flow

### **New Customer Branch Resolution:**

```
1. Fetch all customers (role="customer")
        ↓
2. Fetch all orders
        ↓
3. For each customer:
   ├─ Filter orders by customer.id
   ├─ Sort by -created (newest first)
   ├─ Get first order's branch
   └─ Assign as lastOrderBranch
        ↓
4. For Admin users:
   ├─ Get admin's branch_details
   ├─ Filter customers where lastOrderBranch matches admin's branch
   └─ Return filtered customers
        ↓
5. Display in table with last order branch
```

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### **Behavior Changes:**

| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Customer with no orders | Shows "Unassigned" | Shows "No Orders" |
| Customer ordered from Branch A | Shows Branch A (if set in user record) | Shows Branch A (from last order) |
| Customer ordered from A, then B | Shows A (static) | Shows B (most recent) |
| Admin viewing customers | Sees customers with admin's branch_details | Sees customers who last ordered from admin's branch |

### **Performance Considerations:**

**Before:**
- ✅ Single query with expand
- ✅ Fast (direct relation)

**After:**
- ⚠️ Two queries (users + orders)
- ⚠️ Client-side filtering
- ⚠️ Slightly slower for large datasets

**Optimization Note:**
For production with many customers/orders, consider:
1. Backend aggregation query
2. Caching last order branch
3. Database view or computed field

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### **Super-Admin:**
- [ ] Open `/customers` page
- [ ] Verify all customers shown
- [ ] Check "Last Order Branch" column exists
- [ ] Verify customers with orders show branch badge
- [ ] Verify customers without orders show "No Orders" badge
- [ ] Open branch filter dropdown
- [ ] Select "No Orders Yet" - verify only customers with no orders shown
- [ ] Select specific branch - verify only customers who last ordered from that branch shown
- [ ] Click view on a customer
- [ ] Verify "Last Order Branch" card shows correct info
- [ ] Verify info text: "This is the branch from the customer's most recent order"

### **Admin:**
- [ ] Open `/customers` page as admin with branch assignment
- [ ] Verify only customers who last ordered from admin's branch are shown
- [ ] Verify info banner: "Viewing customers who last ordered from your branch"
- [ ] Create test: Have customer order from another branch
- [ ] Verify customer disappears from list
- [ ] Have customer order from admin's branch again
- [ ] Verify customer reappears in list

### **Edge Cases:**
- [ ] Customer with multiple orders - shows most recent branch
- [ ] Customer switches branches - shows new branch immediately
- [ ] Customer with cancelled orders - still counts as last order
- [ ] New customer with no orders - shows "No Orders"
- [ ] Admin with no branch assignment - sees no customers

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### **Potential Improvements:**

1. **Show Branch History:**
   ```javascript
   orderHistory: [
     { branch: "Branch A", orderCount: 5, lastOrder: "2024-10-01" },
     { branch: "Branch B", orderCount: 2, lastOrder: "2025-10-06" }
   ]
   ```

2. **Preferred Branch Logic:**
   - Most frequent branch (not just last)
   - Branch with highest total spending
   - Configurable preference

3. **Branch Affinity Score:**
   ```javascript
   branchAffinity: {
     "Branch A": 0.70,  // 70% of orders
     "Branch B": 0.30   // 30% of orders
   }
   ```

4. **Backend Optimization:**
   - Add `last_order_branch` computed field to users table
   - Update via trigger on order creation
   - Faster queries, same behavior

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Data Consistency:**
- Customer's branch changes when they place a new order
- Historical data remains intact (order records unchanged)
- No database migration needed (logic change only)

### **Admin Visibility:**
- Admin may "lose" customers if they order from another branch
- This is expected behavior
- Customers aren't deleted, just filtered out

### **Customer Records:**
- No changes to user records
- `branch_details` field on users (if exists) is now ignored
- All logic based on order history

---

## ✅ Summary

**Problem:** Customer branch assignment was based on static user field, not actual ordering behavior.

**Solution:** Customer's branch is now determined by their most recent order.

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Updated service layer to fetch orders and compute last order branch
2. ✅ Updated all components to use `lastOrderBranch` instead of `branch_details`
3. ✅ Changed UI text and labels to reflect "Last Order Branch"
4. ✅ Updated filter options: "Unassigned" → "No Orders Yet"
5. ✅ Added helpful info text in customer details

**Impact:**
- More accurate customer-branch relationships
- Dynamic assignment based on behavior
- Better experience for branch admins
- No breaking changes to database schema

**Status:** ✅ Complete and ready for testing
