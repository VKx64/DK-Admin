## 💡 Rationale

### **Why Remove from Super Admin?**

1. **Branch-Specific Management**
   - Service history is typically managed at the branch level
   - Admins handle day-to-day service operations
   - Super admins focus on overview and branch management

2. **Role Clarity**
   - Super Admin = Strategic oversight, branch management, analytics
   - Admin = Operational management, service tracking, daily operations
   - Technician = Service execution, delivery tasks

3. **Reduced Clutter**
   - Super admins have access to many features
   - Removing branch-specific operational tabs streamlines their interface
   - Focus on high-level management tasks

4. **Access Control**
   - Admins have direct responsibility for service history in their branch
   - Super admins can still access via direct URL if needed (no hard block)
   - UI navigation reflects primary responsibilities

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### **Super Admin:**
- [ ] Log in as super-admin
- [ ] Check sidebar navigation
- [ ] Verify "Service History" link is NOT visible
- [ ] Verify all other navigation items are present
- [ ] Test navigation to other sections works correctly
- [ ] (Optional) Try accessing `/service_history` directly via URL

### **Admin:**
- [ ] Log in as admin
- [ ] Check sidebar navigation
- [ ] Verify "Service History" link IS visible
- [ ] Click "Service History" → Should navigate to service history page
- [ ] Verify link appears between "Service" and "Analytics"

### **Technician:**
- [ ] Log in as technician
- [ ] Check sidebar navigation
- [ ] Verify "Service History" is NOT visible (technicians never had it)
- [ ] Verify only "My Details", "My Deliveries", and "Service" are shown

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### **Important Notes:**

1. **UI-Level Change Only**
   - This change only removes the navigation link
   - Does NOT add server-side access control
   - Super admins can still access `/service_history` via direct URL

2. **Recommended: Add Route Protection**
   ```jsx
   // In /app/service_history/page.jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     if (user && user.role === 'super-admin') {
       router.push('/analytics'); // Redirect super-admins
       toast.error('Access Denied', {
         description: 'Service History is available only for Branch Admins'
       });
     }
   }, [user, router]);
   ```

3. **Backend Validation**
   - Ensure API endpoints validate user role
   - Service history data should respect branch assignments
   - Consider adding role checks in service history service layer

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### **Affected Users:**

| Role | Impact | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Super Admin | ⚠️ Lost navigation link | Can still access via URL, focus on high-level management |
| Admin | ✅ No change | Maintains full access to service history |
| Technician | ✅ No change | Never had access |
| Customer | ✅ No change | No access to admin portal |

### **User Experience:**

**Super Admin:**
- ✅ Cleaner, more focused navigation
- ✅ Less clutter in sidebar
- ✅ Clear role separation

- ✅ No impact
- ✅ Clear that service history is their responsibility

---

## 🔄 Rollback Instructions

If this change needs to be reverted:

```jsx
// In SideNavigation.jsx, change:
{(isAdmin) && <ItemNavigation 
  icon={"mingcute:history-line"} 
  text={"Service History"} 
  href={'/service_history'} 
/>}

// Back to:
{(isAdmin || isSuperAdmin) && <ItemNavigation 
  icon={"mingcute:history-line"} 
  text={"Service History"} 
  href={'/service_history'} 
/>}
```

---

## 🎯 Related Changes to Consider

### **1. Route Protection (Recommended)**
Add role check in `/app/service_history/page.jsx`:
```jsx
// Redirect super-admins away from this page
if (user?.role === 'super-admin') {
  router.push('/analytics');
}
```

### **2. Update Documentation**
- Update user guides to reflect role-specific features
- Clarify that service history is admin-only
- Document which features belong to which roles

### **3. Consistent Role Logic**
Consider reviewing other features for similar role-specific access:
- Should super-admins have access to "Service" tab?
- Should there be super-admin-specific reports in Analytics?
- Are there other branch-specific features that should be admin-only?
